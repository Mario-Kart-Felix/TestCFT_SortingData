KT-18891JS: provide a way to declare static members (JsStatic?)
 
KT-44945KJS / IR: Support assignable value parameters
Discovered in Compose JS.

Fields that are created in IR backend with isStatic=true are missing the initializer in generated JS code and return undefined (usually failing with ClassCastException).

Expected behavior:
isStatic is ignored in JS.
